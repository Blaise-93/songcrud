This project is a django project given to me by Zuri team (my mentors).
Here we created songcrud project which houses musicapp project via using pip and other django dependencies.
It was later deployed so that we can add some usecase in our app (musicapp) in the feature.

stage2 of the Assignment: Below are activities carried out in L + CRUD musicapp applications:

We created our forms via forms.py to help us submit our info to database. Thus, we shall use post method in order to achieve that.
We used Bootstrap4 in our project for easy styling and js implementation especially in our buttons outlook.

We installed django crispy forms in our project to make our UI look better especially when rendering our artiste forms.

We deployed navigations, thanks to bootstrap though not clickable because we disabled it intentionally because we have added several navigations in our respective templates of our project for the user to manipulate the artiste,songs and class of our models

Kindly check out my code assignment to see what I did. Thanks you!
